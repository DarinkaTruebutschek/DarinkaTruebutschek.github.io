I am an Assistant Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at Maastricht University, where I have just started my position and am in the process of setting up my research group. My work investigates how the human brain generates and stores subjective experiences - how perception, memory, and decision-making emerge from neural activity, and how they are shaped by our past and guided by our goals. To tackle these questions, I combine psychophysics and eye-tracking with electrophysiology (EEG, MEG, and iEEG), computational modeling, and machine learning.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Beyond my research, I am committed to fostering an open, inclusive, and transparent scientific culture. I actively participate in several open-science initiatives, including serving on the steering committee of the [EEGManyPipelines project](https://eegmanypipelines.github.io/).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Before joining Maastricht, I was a [Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101023805) working with Prof. Lucia Melloni at the [Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-neural-circuits-consciousness-and-cognition.html) in Frankfurt/Main (Germany). Prior to this, I had worked with Prof. Mark Stokes at the [University of Oxford](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/news/in-memoriam-mark-stokes) (UK) as a postdoctoral research fellow funded by the [Fondation Fyssen](https://www.fondationfyssen.fr/en/) and completed my PhD with Prof. Stanislas Dehaene at [Neurospin](https://www.unicog.org/) (Paris, France).
