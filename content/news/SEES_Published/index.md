Our recent [preprint]({{< relref "/publication/sarafoglou-subjective-2024" >}}), led by the amazing Alexandra, has just been published in Royal Society Open Science. In this study, we developed a subjective evidence evaluation scale for multi-analyst studies in order to be able to take into account analysts' subjective views on the appropriateness of the research design and the strength of the evidence for the hypothesis. Check out the paper or get in touch if you want to know more!
