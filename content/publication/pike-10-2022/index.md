abstract: Abstract The transition to principal investigator (PI), or lab leader, can
  be challenging, partially due to the need to fulfil new managerial and leadership
  responsibilities. One key aspect of this role, which is often not explicitly discussed,
  is creating a supportive lab environment. Here, we present ten simple rules to guide
  the new PI in the development of their own positive and thriving lab atmosphere.
  These rules were written and voted on collaboratively, by the students and mentees
  of Professor Mark Stokes, who inspired this piece.
