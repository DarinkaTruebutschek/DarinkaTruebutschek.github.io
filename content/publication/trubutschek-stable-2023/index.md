abstract: 'Abstract According to a Bayesian framework, visual perception requires active
  interpretation of noisy sensory signals in light of prior information. One such mechanism,
  serial dependence, is thought to promote perceptual stability by assimilating current 
  percepts with recent stimulus history. Combining a delayed orientation-adjustment paradigm
  with predictable (study 1) or unpredictable (study 2) task structure, we test two key 
  predictions of this account in a novel context: first, that serial dependence should 
  persist even in variable environments, and, second, that, within a given observer and context,
  this behavioral bias should be stable from one occasion to the next. Relying on data of 41 
  human volunteers and two separate experimental sessions, we confirm both hypotheses. Group-level
  attractive serial dependence remained strong even in the face of volatile settings with multiple,
  unpredictable types of tasks, and, despite considerable interindividual variability, within-subject
  patterns of attractive and repulsive stimulus-history biases were highly stable from one 
  experimental session to the next. In line with the hypothesized role of serial dependence,
  we propose that, together with previous work, our findings suggest the existence 
  of a more general individual-specific fingerprint with which the past shapes current percetion.
  Congruent with the Bayesian account, interindividual differences may then result from
  differential weighting of sensory evidence and prior information.'
