abstract: 'Abstract Working memory and conscious perception are thought to share similar brain
  mechanisms, yet recent reports of non-conscious working memory challenge this view.
  Combining visual masking with magnetoencephalography, we investigate the reality
  of non-conscious working memory and dissect its neural mechanisms. In a spatial
  delayed-response task, participants reported the location of a subjectively unseen
  target above chance-level after several seconds. Conscious perception and conscious
  working memory were characterized by similar signatures: a sustained desynchronization
  in the alpha/beta band over frontal cortex, and a decodable representation of target
  location in posterior sensors. During non-conscious working memory, such activity
  vanished. Our findings contradict models that identify working memory with sustained
  neural firing, but are compatible with recent proposals of ‘activity-silent’ working
  memory. We present a theoretical framework and simulations showing how slowly decaying
  synaptic changes allow cell assemblies to go dormant during the delay, yet be retrieved
  above chance-level after several seconds. ,  Many everyday activities require you
  to store information in your brain for immediate use. For example, imagine that
  you are cooking a meal: You have to remember the ingredients, add them in the correct
  order, and operate the stove. This ability is called working memory. Researchers
  have long believed that, whenever we store information in our working memory, we
  are conscious of that information. That is, if someone asks you, you can report
  the information. Scientists usually also think that working memory comes with constant
  brain activity. This means that for as long as you have to remember something, the
  cells in your brain that code for that information will be active. Trübutschek et
  al. now show that we can sometimes store information in working memory without being
  conscious of it and without the need for constant brain activity. As part of the
  experiment, a barely visible square-shaped target was briefly flashed in 1 of 20
  different locations on a computer screen. Human volunteers had to locate the square
  and indicate whether they had seen it or not. Importantly, they had to guess the
  location of the target whenever they had not seen it. While the volunteers performed
  this task, their brain activity was monitored using magnetoencephalography, a noninvasive
  technique that captures the magnetic fields created by electrical signals in the
  brain. Even when the volunteers had not seen the target, they could often correctly
  guess where it had been up to four seconds later, more often than would be predicted
  by chance alone. The experiment ruled out the possibility that this so-called “blindsight”
  was simply due to the volunteers accidentally reporting not having seen a target,
  when they had actually seen it. It also excluded the possibility that the volunteers
  guessed the location long before they had to report it and simply consciously stored
  that guess. Instead, without the participant knowing, the brain appears to have
  stored the target location in working memory using parts of the brain near the back
  of the head that process visual information. Importantly, this non-conscious storage
  did not come with constant brain activity, but seemed to rely on other, “activity-silent”
  mechanisms that are hidden to standard recording techniques. Although Trübutschek
  et al. show that the brain can unknowingly store information, they did not test
  other aspects of working memory. Future studies are needed to examine whether the
  brain can also non-consciously manipulate or use information in its working memory.
  In addition, future research also needs to investigate the exact mechanism that
  stores information without constant brain activity.'
