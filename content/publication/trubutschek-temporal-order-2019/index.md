abstract: Abstract Classical theories hold conscious perception and working memory
  to be tightly interwoven. Recent work has challenged this assumption, demonstrating
  that information may be stored for several seconds without any subjective awareness.
  Does such non-conscious working memory possess the same functional properties as
  conscious working memory? Here, we probe whether non-conscious working memory can
  maintain multiple items and their temporal order. In a visual masking task with
  a delayed response, 38 participants were asked to retain the location and order
  of presentation of two sequentially flashed spatial positions, and retrieve both
  after a 2.5 second delay. Even when subjective visibility was nil, subjects’ objective
  forced-choice performance exceeded chance level and, crucially, distinct retrieval
  of the first and second location was observed on both conscious and non-conscious
  trials. Non-conscious working memory may therefore store two items in proper temporal
  order. These findings can be explained by recent models of activity-silent working
  memory.
