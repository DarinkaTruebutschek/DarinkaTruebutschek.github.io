abstract: Many-analysts studies explore how well an empirical claim withstands plausible
  alternative analyses of the same data set by multiple, independent analysis teams.
  Conclusions from these studies typically rely on a single outcome metric (e.g.,
  effect size) provided by each analysis team. Although informative about the range
  of plausible effects in a data set, a single effect size from each team does not
  provide a complete, nuanced understanding of how analysis choices are related to
  the outcome. We used the Delphi consensus technique with input from 37 experts to
  develop an 18-item Subjective Evidence Evaluation Survey (SEES) to evaluate how
  each analysis team views the methodological appropriateness of the research design
  and the strength of evidence for the hypothesis. We illustrate the usefulness of
  the SEES in providing richer evidence assessment with pilot data from a previous
  many-analysts study.
